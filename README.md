# Banking System

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started, first clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aarjav638/Banking-System.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Banking-System
```

### Install Dependencies

Next, install the project dependencies. You can use `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
